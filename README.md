# Cosmic Horizons Generator
Data Pack Generator for Cosmic Horizons (and java edition 1.20)

Forked from https://misode.github.io/ . Thanks guys for the super generous forking rules! :D

Though, in an attempt to not simply steal their entire website, we _have_ made some large changes.

(Along with the changes they recommend in the readme)

Most notably, we have removed all Minecraft versions except 1.20(.1), since thats the only version Cosmic Horizons supports.

We have also removed the other modded generators. We highly recommend you checkout misode.github.io for these features, 
and if neccesary datapacks can be imported as projects between these sites

## Translations

We have re-used the language translation files from Misode, with some slight tweaks. But we are happy to take these down, and try to build our own language files, if Misode would like us to.
